# Welcome, contributors!

We're hoping that Netlify CMS will do for the [JAMstack](https://www.jamstack.org) what WordPress did for dynamic sites back in the day. We know we can't do that without building a thriving community of contributors and users, and we'd love to have you join us.

While we work on building this page (and you can help!), here are some links with more information about getting involved:

* [Project Milestones](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/milestones)
* [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* [Setup instructions and Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
