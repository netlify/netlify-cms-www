# Take a test drive

You can easily try out Netlify CMS by running it on a pre-configured starter site. Our example in the intro is the [Kaldi small business Hugo template](https://github.com/netlify-templates/kaldi-hugo-cms-template). Use the deploy button below to build and deploy your own copy of the repository:

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify-templates/kaldi-hugo-cms-template)

## Authenticate with GitHub

When the deploy completes, you can see your site, but in order to use the CMS, you'll need to set up authentication with GitHub.

First, register the site CMS as an authorized application with your GitHub account:
 
 1. Go to your account **Settings** page on GitHub, and click **Oauth Applications** under **Developer Settings** (or use [this shortcut](https://github.com/settings/developers)).
 2. Click **Register a new application**.
 3. For the **Authorization callback URL**, enter `https://api.netlify.com/auth/done`. The other fields can contain anything you want.

When you complete the registration, you'll be given a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret** for the app. You'll need to add these to your Netlify project:
 
 1. Go to your [**Netlify dashboard**](https://app.netlify.com/) and click on your project.
 2. Click the **Access** tab.
 3. Under **Authentication Providers**, click **Install Provider**.
 4. Select GitHub and enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, then save.

## Access the CMS

With the site deployed and authentication in place, you'll be able to enter the CMS by going to the URL of your new site and appending `/admin`.
